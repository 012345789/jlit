	<h5>Your brain suddenly makes an entire network of connections that you never knew existed.</h5>
	<h5>You tap into your ancestor's memories that were stored inside your DNA since your conception.</h5>
	<h5>You look around. You look at yourself.</h5>
	<h5>You are Joji. And you notice a young girl working as a hostess at the cafe you are sitting at.</h5>
	<h5>Her appearance captivates you.</h5>
	<h5>When the two of you are near, you ask her for her name. It's Naomi.</h5>
	<h5>You ask Naomi if she would like to live with you while you pay for her expenses.</h5>
	<h5>She is skeptical at first. But you might be able to convince her.</h5>
	<h5>What are you wearing?</h5>
